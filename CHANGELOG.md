### Migration Guide for Developers

If you're updating from the previous version:

1. Ensure your main App component wraps game components with `<GameStateProvider>`
2. Update any direct `useGameState` imports - the hook is now a Context consumer
3. Remove any old `useGameState.ts` file references
4. Test RTL layout if your app supports Hebrew/Arabic languages
